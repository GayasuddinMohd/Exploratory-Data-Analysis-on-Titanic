# Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic
This is the in depth Exploratory Data Analysis of the Titanic Dataset , with beautiful and simple visualizations plots which will helps to understand the insights easily.The Titanic dataset is a classic and widely studied dataset that provides insights into the passengers aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic's maiden voyage. In this exploratory data analysis (EDA), we will delve into the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and narratives related to the passengers' demographics, ticket information, cabin classes, and survival rates.

# Repository Overview
This repository is about EDA performed on the Titanic.
   - It has a python notebook where all the coding has been done.
   - It also has the relevant datasets and files used for this analysis.

# Summary
* From the above EDA, we can say that there were more male passengers on the Titanic as compared to the female passengers.
* From the above EDA, we can say that most of the passengers are from 3rd class.
* From the above EDA, we can say that most of the male passengers as we all as female passengers are from the 3rd class.
* From the above EDA, we can say that there are 537 males, 271 females and 83 childrens on the Titanic.
* From the above EDA, we can say that most of the passengers on Titanic have age between the range of 18-32.
* From the above EDA, we can say that first class passengers belonged more to the middle age groups, with very few childrens. Second and third class had more childrens,with relatively fewer older people.
* From the above EDA, we can say that most of the younger passengers are female, most of the middle ages and aged passengers are male on the Titanic.
* From the above EDA, we can say that the upper Deck(A,B,C) has only passengers from the class 1. And the passengers from class 3rd start from lower Deck E.
* From the above EDA, we can say, most of the passengers are from Southampton on Titanic.
* From the above EDA, we can say that majority of the passengers on the ship were with their family members.
* From the above EDA, we can say that most of the passengers were not survived on the Titanic.
* From the above EDA, we can say that most of the passengers are survived from class 1 because they have higher Deck on the ship, and there are very few passengers from class 3 who survived because they have lower Deck on the ship.
* From the above EDA, we can say that male has less chance of survived than female or child on the Titanic.Among females passengers and child passengers those who are on the class 3 have less chances of survival than that of class 1 and class 2.
* From the above EDA, we can say that the older passengers has very less chances of survival as compared to the younger passengers.
* From the above EDA, we can say that, the passengers who have younger in age and of class 1 has greater chances of survival than that of who have older age and of class 3.
